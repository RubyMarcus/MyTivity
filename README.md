# MyTivity
An application for creating events and meeting people.

This application uses:
* Firebase
* Material Design
* Data-Binding
* Google Maps

The project was build by four students and the goal was to create an app that helps people come together.
My focus was mostly on the creating of an event. Were I had to work with google maps to choose location and a calendar for
choosing date and time. When that was completed I helped my team with some other things such as login and refactoring code.
